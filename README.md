Predicting the Nodes that will be Reached on a Citation Network Next Using Monte Carlo Simulations of a Markov Chain

By Kylie Phommasack

This repository contains the files to complete the simulation.
- Citation Network Biases - Identifier Notebook.ipynb : This Jupyter Notebook contains the code needed to run the simulation. A detailed introduction, conclusion, and further explanations are provided in this notebook.
- cit-HepTh.txt : This text file contains the citation network that was used in the simulation.

  The data was released as part of research papers in 2003, which includes:
  J. Leskovec, J. Kleinberg and C. Faloutsos. Graphs over Time: Densification Laws, Shrinking Diameters and Possible Explanations. ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2005.

This project was completed in Fall 2025 as the Final Project for Kansas State University MATH 725 - The Mathematics of Data & Networks I
